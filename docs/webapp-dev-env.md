# Front-end development instructions

## Setup

Run the following commands at `webapp` directory: `npm install` or `yarn`. This would help you install the dependency libraries.

Run `npm run start` or `yarn start` to start the dev server. Then the React app would be available on `localhost:3000`. The dev server would update the app each time you save a change to the project dynamically.
