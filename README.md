## Notes for developers

### Commits

Best practice for commit messages:

```text
<type>(scope): <subject>

<body>
```

"type" can be:

1. `feat`: new features.
2. `fix`: bug fix.
3. `docs`: add documents or comments.
4. `style`: it should not affect logics.
5. `refactor`: refactor codes and it should not alter the results.
6. `test`: add tests.
7. `chore`: building tools or so.

"scope" is optional. "body" is optional.

### Pull request

We branch the codes when we need to add feature or fix bugs. The branch \ 
name can address the task. A branch should be deleted after it's merged.
