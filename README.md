# Shiba Match

Shiba Match is an App which helps users make decisions on which place to go for gatherings. Sometimes a group cannot decide upon a restaurant or hotel to go to, which causes unnecessary time to ping-pong ideas of where to go to. Additionally, we always have to search through the web to check for good places that suit the group's preferences, which takes more time. This is where ShibaMatch comes in. On ShibaMatch each individual user in the group can independently swipe left or right on cards to indicate if they like that particular place.

## Tech stacks

## Notes for developers

### Commits

Best practice for commit messages:

```text
<type>(scope): <subject>

<body>
```

"type" can be:

1. `feat`: new features.
2. `fix`: bug fix.
3. `docs`: add documents or comments.
4. `style`: it should not affect logics.
5. `refactor`: refactor codes and it should not alter the results.
6. `test`: add tests.
7. `chore`: building tools or so.

"scope" is optional. "body" is optional.

### Pull request

We branch the codes when we need to add feature or fix bugs. The branch \ 
name can address the task. A branch should be deleted after it's merged.
